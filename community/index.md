OrbitDB has an active developer community. Your best place to find us is on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/orbitdb/Lobby).
We also have communities on [Matrix](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#orbit-db:matrix.org) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/v3RNE3M). And all of these chats are bridged together!

## Code of Conduct

We're dedicated to having a safe, awesome community. We have a Code of Conduct that enshrines what we value, and what we tolerate in our community spaces - here, on Twitter, on Gitter, and so on. Go [read it](https://github.com/orbitdb/welcome/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)!
